## Code Explanation

The code is structured into several functions that handle different aspects of the EA's operation. Here is a breakdown of each function:

1. `OnInit()`: This function is called during the initialization of the EA. It checks if the current day is the selected trading day and sets up the trading timer accordingly. It then enters a loop where it checks if the market conditions are suitable for trading. If the conditions are met, it executes the trading algorithm. It waits for the next trading interval before repeating the process.

2. `IsMarketConditionsSuitable()`: This function is responsible for checking if the market conditions are suitable for trading. You can add your own market condition rules here. Return `true` if the conditions are suitable for trading, otherwise return `false`.

3. `ExecuteTradingAlgorithm()`: This function is where you can add your trading algorithm. You can place your trades based on your strategy here. It is important to avoid using the Martingale approach to manage risk.

4. `OnDeinit()`: This function is called during the deinitialization of the EA. You can add any necessary cleanup code here.

5. `OnTick()`: This function is called on every tick. You can add any necessary tick processing code here.

Please note that this code is a sample and may need to be customized based on your specific trading strategy and requirements.
